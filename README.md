Module 1: Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration

1.1. Introduction To Semiconductor Packaging And Industry Overview

	• The chips are manufactured in a highly protected and clean environment. The chips usage is in real world which won't be same as its protected manufacturing environment. 
	• The purpose of semiconductor packaging is to give protection of the semiconductor devices in the die and to enable the interaction of one die to other dies/components in the outside world.
	• In a fundamental level, a packaging will have
		○ Die - Main semiconductor chip containing integrated circuits
		○ Substrate - The base layer where the die sits on. It is also called as carrier. It includes the trace and contact points for external connections
		○ Die Attach - Adhesive material used to attach Die to Substrate
		○ Wire/Solder bond - Bonding to have chip connections to outside world
		○ Molding Compound - Protective encapsulant (epoxy material) that surrounds die and wire bonds.
		○ Trace - Conductive pathways on substrate for having electrical connections.
